When making a module, make sure to make the appropriate changes to the Makefile and Kconfig. The module should be set as "tristate" in Kconfig so that we get (y/n/m) options.

To get the *.ko file, make sure that the device is set to "=m" in the .config

Bring the module in the VM with SCP and using the "insmod" command to use it.
You can also use modinfo so see the module parameters.
parameters do not need to be set as they have a default value hardcoded in the module.

After ismoding, you will get a message saying the device has no filesystem.
The message will also have the device name (something like sbd0 for sbd.ko)
(You can also figure out the dev name by looking in /sys/dev)

To create a filesystem on the device, use:
	"mkfs -t ext2 /dev/<dev-name>"

Then, mount it to a directory (we usually use /mnt):
	"mount -t ext2 /dev/<dev-name> /mnt"

where <dev-name> was the name of the device.
You can now navigate to /mnt to write and read from the module
